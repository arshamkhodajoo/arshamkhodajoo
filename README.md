### Hey, I'm Arsham

I'm someone who is passionate about **Machine Learning and Robotics** and their healthcare applications.

I study **Deep learning** in the medical analysis field such as brain tumor segmentation of health anomaly detection systems.

I mostly write **Python** and use [**#Pytorch**](https://pytorch.org/) these days, I have 4+ years of background experience on **Backend** with [**#Django**](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and have been studying **Machine Learning** for 2 years now.

I sometimes prototype & design medical products which involves CAD design using [**#Solidworks**](https://www.solidworks.com/) and hardware design using [**#AltiumDesigner**](https://www.altium.com/); usually get brainstorm about the potential of on-device, offline recognition systems with real-time response.

(a lot of buzz words... I mean hardware that runs neural networks fast, on its own.)
