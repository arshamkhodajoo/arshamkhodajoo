### Hey, I'm Arsham

I'm someone who is passionate about **Machine Learning and Robotics** and their healthcare applications.

<br>
<br>

I mostly write **Python** and use [**#Pytorch**](https://pytorch.org/) these days, I have 4+ years background experience on **Backend** with [**#Django**](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and has been studying **Machine Learning and Deep Learning** for 2 years now.

I sometimes prototype & design medical products which involves CAD design using [**#Solidworks**](https://www.solidworks.com/) and hardware design using [**#AltiumDesigner**](https://www.altium.com/) and **3D prints**; alot to be done, still learning.
